# Repo_Startup_Template
 Template for new repository
 
 Use this as a template for new R projects: 
 1. Has repository set up via Github Desktop with Git sync and "git ignore" for R (and readme file)
 2. R project created under the repo. working directory
 3. .rmd created with for R code (with template header)
 Note: to show hidden files on Mac: cmd + shift + period key
 tip: cmd + shift + c = quick comment/uncomment chunks
 Note from Ben: push to Git at end of day, knit at end of an analysis question. After knit, save as new .rmd file with new data. Clear environment and delete output folders before knit to make sure there isn't a missing variable in code.
